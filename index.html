            <h1>Architectural History and the Sexual Liberation Movement</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 24px; color: #bbb;">How has architecture both shaped and responded to the evolution of
                sexual norms? This research examines the spatial dimensions of sexual liberation, analyzing how
                architecture and urban planning reflect shifting attitudes toward sex, privacy, gender roles, and bodily
                autonomy.</p>

            <h2>Research Abstract / Arc of Argument</h2>
            <p>From the private domestic sphere of the Victorian era, to the sexual openness of countercultural
                movements in the 1960s and 70s, to contemporary debates around sex-positive urbanism, architecture has
                played a crucial role in either restricting or enabling sexual expression. Using Michel Foucault’s
                biopolitics and Henri Lefebvre’s theory of social space, this study explores how built environments
                regulate sexuality—whether through moralistic zoning laws, feminist reclaiming of space, the rise of
                erotic leisure architecture, or contemporary policies on public intimacy.</p>

            <h2>Michel Foucault: The History of Sexuality</h2>
            <p>"The notion that repression is the fundamental link between power, knowledge, and sexuality appears to me
                wholly inadequate. Rather than a massive censorship, beginning with the verbal proprieties imposed by
                the Age of Reason, what was involved was the regulated and polymorphous incitement to discourse."(p.
                12)</p>
            <div class="quote">This passage criticises the traditional repressive hypothesis, arguing that rather than
                exerting power by repressing sexuality, modern society is constantly creating discussions about
                sexuality that prompt people to talk and think about it in new ways.</div>

            <p>"Sexuality must not be thought of as a stubborn drive by which we attempt to resist the law, but rather
                as a complex political network. It is the name that can be given to a historical construct: not a
                furtive reality that is difficult to grasp, but a great surface network in which the stimulation of
                bodies, the intensification of pleasures, the incitement to discourse, the formation of special
                knowledges, the strengthening of controls and resistances, are linked to one another, in accordance with
                a few major strategies of knowledge and power.(p. 105-106)"</p>
            <div class="quote">Foucault argues that sexuality is not a hidden, essential reality, but rather a
                historical construct that is incorporated into a whole network of power-knowledge.</div>

                a political existence; modern man is an animal whose politics places his existence as a living being in
                question.(p. 143)"</p>
            <div class="quote">Here Foucault introduces the concept of biopower, the idea that modern power goes beyond
                legal constraints and reaches into the management of life itself, including the control of population,
                health, sexuality and reproduction.</div>

                action; that in addition to being a means of production it is also a means of control, and hence of
                domination, of power."(p. 26)</p>
            <div class="quote">Lefebvre's central argument is that space does not exist neutrally or naturally, but is
                the result of social production. Space is not only a passive context, but also becomes an instrument of
                power control and social relations.</div>

            <p>“(1)Spatial practice, which embraces production and reproduction, and the particular locations and
                spatial sets characteristic of each social formation; (2) representations of space, which are tied to
                the relations of production and to the ‘order’ which those relations impose; (3) representational
                spaces, embodying complex symbolisms, sometimes coded, sometimes not, linked to the clandestine or
                underground side of social life, as also to art.”(p. 33)</p>
            <div class="quote">Lefebvre proposed a threefold concept of space:
                Spatial practice - the use of space in everyday life, with an emphasis on physicality and
                perceptibility.
                Representations of space - the rational conception of space by planners, governments, and scientific and
                technological fields.

            <div class="quote">Capitalism produces an abstract space through standardisation, commodification and

            <div class="quote">According to Lefebvre, space is not only an object of struggle for physical resources,

            <p>"Le Corbusier’s work is inseparable from its images. His architecture is not simply built, it is
                published, exhibited, photographed—it exists in a system of representation as much as in the real
                world."(p. 167)</p>
            <div class="quote">Le Corbusier is not only an architect, but also a communicator who makes good use of
                media. His architecture exists not only in real space, but also in media such as publications,
                photography and exhibitions, which makes his architecture more of a visual cultural phenomenon.</div>

            <p>"Transparency in modern architecture does not simply imply openness or accessibility; it is a mechanism
                of control, surveillance, and the production of new subjectivities."(p. 213)</p>
            <div class="quote">Colomina critically analyses the modernist promotion of ‘transparency’, pointing out that
                glass architecture does not only symbolise openness, but also involves surveillance, control and the
                remodelling of subjectivity.</div>
